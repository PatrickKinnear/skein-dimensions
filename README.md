###Skein Module Dimension Estimates

A project to estimate the dimensions of skein modules of twisted 3d tori.

Takes growing shells of lattice points representing generators, finds relations, and reduces.

If dimension estimates stabilise as the shells grow, this suggests a version of the diamond lemma holds and gives an upper bound on the dimension.

Currently only implemented naively for triangular shells, and for the basic 3-torus T^3.
